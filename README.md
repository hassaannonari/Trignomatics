Hello, I am Muhammad Hassaan Awais, I am Student of ICS-2nd Year in PGC Okara and did my matriculation in 2023 from DPS Depalpur. I am very interested in Programming and Music. 
I also love spending time with friends and exploring natural things.
Developer of Trignomatics Software purely developed in C++ to help the students and Mathematicians to solve their problems related to trignometry easily by just choosing the options and by using the predefined formulae in it. 
This Project consists of Several file including:
1: Function.cpp: It contains all the predefined trignometric functions in it.
2: builder.cpp: It supports the functions.cpp by calling these functions and organizing them in a correct manner for basic input and output.
3: trignomatics.cpp: It is the file that contains the main function to execute the code in builder.cpp(whole code)
4: libs.cpp: It includes the possible libraries that can be used in this project.
5: readme.txt: It contains the general information about the project and basic contact information.
6: definitions.cpp: It contains the possible definitions of topics related to trignometry defined in this software.
7: trignomatics.cpp: It is nothing but just an executable file of trignomatics.cpp. It can be run on Windows Operating System.
These all were the files I really appreaciate anyone to contribute to this project fundamentally. Of course, this is an open-source project.
This version of Trignomatics is 24.2.1
